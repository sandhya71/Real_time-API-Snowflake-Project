# Real_time-API-Snowflake-Project

Problem Statement

The goal is to build an Air Quality Index (AQI) Interactive Dashboard that provides real-time or near-real-time air quality data to end-users. The dashboard will display pollutant levels (e.g., PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, O3) and AQI values for various locations, with color-coded indicators to represent air quality (e.g., green for good, red for poor). The challenge is to integrate, process, and transform raw air quality data from multiple sources into a structured, consumable format for visualization.
